# Simple Socket.io JavaScript Game

I created a simple multiplayer game where players take shoot down their opponents. The game is fast-paced and highly competitive, making for an exciting gameplay experience.

This game is good to play on LAN, but also, if you want to play online just open router ports.

#### To install:

```
npm install
```

Then just run:

```
npm start 
```

Have fun!
