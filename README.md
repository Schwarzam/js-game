For my socket.io JavaScript game, I created a simple multiplayer game where players take control of a character and race to the finish line. Players can use power-ups to slow down their opponents, speed themselves up, or jump over obstacles. The game is fast-paced and highly competitive, making for an exciting gameplay experience.

##Development Process:

I developed the game using socket.io for the multiplayer aspect, along with a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end. I worked on the game alone, and one of the biggest challenges I faced was figuring out how to synchronize player movement across multiple clients. After some trial and error, I was able to implement a system that worked well for the game.

##Gameplay Mechanics:

Players control their characters using the arrow keys, with the space bar used to activate power-ups. The objective of the game is to reach the finish line before any of the other players. Along the way, players can collect power-ups that give them an advantage in the race. However, they must be careful not to fall behind or get slowed down by their opponents' power-ups.

##Incomplete Features:

A feature that I would have liked to add was a wider variety of power-ups, as I think this would have added even more excitement to the game.
Maybe this version isnt working, but the code is public to whoever wants it.

##Conclusion:

Overall, creating this socket.io JavaScript game was a fun and rewarding experience. I learned a lot about game development, and I think that the end product was a lot of fun to play. I would recommend this type of project to anyone who is interested in game development or wants to learn more about working with socket.io. In the future, I may come back to this game and add more features or improve upon what is already there.
